Thought for 2s
I'll explain how each major system operates in your CMMS application, focusing on the business logic and workflows rather than code implementation.

How Each System Operates
1. Dashboard System
Operation: Centralized command center that aggregates data from multiple entities to provide real-time operational visibility.

Workflow:

On load, simultaneously fetches statistics from multiple entities (Assets, WorkOrders, Parts, PurchaseRequisitions, etc.)
Uses fetchXxxTotalCount functions with filtered queries to get counts (e.g., assets with status 'down', work orders with status 'open')
Uses fetchXxxPage functions to get recent records (last 10 work orders, critical assets)
Widget system allows customization - layout stored in localStorage per user
Stats are clickable, applying filters to underlying data views
Background polling keeps data fresh without full page reloads
Key Metrics Calculated:

Assets Down: Count of assets where status = 'down'
Assets Needing Maintenance: Count where status = 'maintenance_required'
Open Work Orders: Count where status IN ['open', 'in_progress', 'pending_parts']
Urgent Work Orders: Open WOs where priority IN ['urgent', 'emergency']
Completed This Week: WOs with status = 'completed' and completed_date >= startOfWeek
2. Work Order System
Operation: Complete lifecycle management from task creation through execution to closure, with granular task-level tracking.

Core Workflow:

Creation Phase:

Auto-generates unique WO number (format: WO-YYYY-###)
Associates with an Asset (pulls in asset location, meter reading)
Sets priority, type, assigned technician
Initial status: open
Execution Phase - Work Order Lines:

Each WO can have multiple lines (individual tasks)
Each line gets a sequential line_number
Per-line tracking:
Status: pending → in_progress → completed → closed
VMRS Code: For standardized categorization
3Cs: Complaint, Cause, Correction documentation
Timer System: Multiple technicians can run concurrent timers on a single line
Timer starts: Adds entry to active_timers array with {user_email, started_at, hourly_rate}
Timer stops: Calculates elapsed minutes, removes from active_timers, adds to timer_minutes
Creates WorkOrderTransaction of type time_entry
Manual Time: Technicians can log time without timer (adds to manual_time_minutes)
Parts Consumption:
Select parts from inventory or enter manually
Deducts quantity_on_hand from Part entity
Creates part_consumption transaction
Creates PartUsageHistory record
Adds to line's parts_used array
Status Propagation Logic:

Line to WO: If ANY line is in_progress, WO becomes in_progress
Line to Asset: If line status is on_hold with a reason_for_hold, this reason aggregates to the parent Asset's reason_for_status field
WO to Asset: If WO status changes to pending_parts, Asset status updates to waiting_on_parts
Cost Calculation:

Labor Cost per Line: (timer_minutes + manual_time_minutes) / 60 * hourly_rate
Parts Cost per Line: Sum of (quantity_used * unit_cost) for all parts in parts_used[]
Total Line Cost: labor_cost + parts_cost + outside_repair_cost + misc_cost
Total WO Cost: Sum of all line costs + outside_service_cost
Completion Phase:

Technician marks line as completed
If line is linked to a PM (pm_id exists), triggers PM update:
Updates PMAssetInstance.last_done_date and last_done_reading
Calculates next_due_date and next_due_reading based on PM interval
Manager reviews completed WO in "Ready for Review"
Manager closes WO (sets status to closed, locks all lines)
Optional: Signature capture on closure for proof of completion
Transaction Ledger:

Immutable audit log of ALL actions
Every part consumption, time entry, status change creates a transaction
Reversals: Don't delete original transaction, create a new part_reversal or time_reversal transaction with negative values
Provides complete forensic trail
Deferred Work Flow:

Technician identifies a task that can't be completed now
Opens "Defer Line" dialog
Options:
Defer to specific future date
Defer to a PM (associates with a PM schedule for future execution)
Enter defer reason
Line status changes to deferred, removed from current WO
Appears in "Deferred Lines" tab for future assignment
Part Request Flow (from WO Line):

Technician realizes they need a part not in inventory
Clicks "Request Parts" on a line
Creates PartRequest entity linked to the WO line
Part request status: pending
Parts clerk sees request in Part Requests page
Can order part, create requisition, or mark as fulfilled
When fulfilled, technician is notified to complete the line
3. Estimate System
Operation: Pre-work cost estimation with approval workflow, nearly identical to work orders but without inventory deduction.

Key Differences from Work Orders:

Status workflow: draft → open → in_progress → pending_review → approved/rejected
Parts added to lines do NOT deduct from inventory (uses parts_used array but no transaction created)
Used for customer quotes, manager approval before work
Can be converted to Work Order upon approval (copies all lines, parts, notes)
Outside vendor cost estimation is more prominent (used for RFQs)
4. Asset System
Operation: Central registry of all physical equipment with status tracking and hierarchical organization.

Hierarchy Logic:

Assets can have a parent_asset_id (e.g., a pump is child of a production line)
asset_hierarchy_path stores full path (e.g., /production_line/pump_station/pump_1)
hierarchy_level indicates depth (0 = root, 1 = child, 2 = grandchild, etc.)
Enables reporting at any level (all work orders for a production line includes child assets)
Status Management:

Operational: Asset is working normally
Maintenance Required: Triggered by PM due or manual flag
Performing Maintenance: Auto-set when WO status is in_progress
Waiting on Parts: Auto-set when WO status is pending_parts
Down: Manual flag for non-operational assets, highest priority
Retired: Asset no longer in service
Reason for Status:

Aggregated from all WorkOrderLine records for this asset where status = 'on_hold'
Concatenates all reason_for_hold values
Example: "Waiting for hydraulic seal, Needs electrical inspection"
Gives at-a-glance view of WHY an asset is in its current state
Meter Reading System:

Tracks usage (hours for equipment, miles for vehicles)
Used for PM scheduling (e.g., PM due every 5,000 miles)
Captured at WO creation as asset_meter_reading for historical context
Batch update feature allows updating multiple assets at once
Custom Fields:

Schema defined in CustomField entity
Stored as JSON in custom_fields object on Asset
Allows industry-specific data (e.g., tonnage for cranes, BTU for HVAC)
5. Inventory & Parts System
Operation: Real-time inventory tracking with automated reorder alerts and multi-location support.

Stock Level Management:

Quantity on Hand: Current inventory count
Reorder Point: When to trigger alert (e.g., 5 units)
Min Quantity: Absolute minimum stock level
Max Quantity: Maximum to order up to
When quantity_on_hand <= reorder_point, creates ReorderAlert
Part Consumption Flow:

Technician posts parts on WO line
System checks if quantity_on_hand >= quantity_requested
If yes:
Deducts from Part.quantity_on_hand
Creates WorkOrderTransaction (type: part_consumption)
Creates PartUsageHistory record
Adds to WorkOrderLine.parts_used[]
If no: Shows error, prompts to create Part Request
ABC Classification:

A-Parts: High value, 20% of items, 80% of value (tight control, frequent cycle counts)
B-Parts: Medium value, 30% of items, 15% of value
C-Parts: Low value, 50% of items, 5% of value (loose control, infrequent counts)
Calculated by backend function based on annual_usage_quantity * unit_cost
Cycle Counting:

Scheduled: Each part has cycle_count_frequency_days based on ABC class
Next Count Date: last_cycle_count_date + cycle_count_frequency_days
Execution: User enters actual counted quantity, system reconciles difference
Creates CycleCount record with variance tracking
Serial Number Tracking:

If is_serialized = true, each unit has a unique serial number
PartSerialNumber entity tracks each unit's lifecycle
On consumption, serial number is marked as "used" with WO reference
6. Procurement System
Operation: Full procure-to-pay workflow with multi-level approval and vendor management.

End-to-End Flow:

Part Request (Technician → Parts Clerk)

Created from WO line: "I need 2x hydraulic seals"
Status: pending
Urgency: standard, urgent, or critical
Can include estimated cost, vendor preference
Purchase Requisition (Parts Clerk → Manager)

Parts clerk reviews multiple part requests
Consolidates similar requests into a requisition
Requisition contains:
Multiple line items (each with part, quantity, estimated cost)
Requesting location
Justification notes
Submits for approval (status: submitted)
Manager reviews and approves/rejects
If approved, status: approved
Purchase Order (Parts Clerk → Vendor)

Approved requisition converts to PO
PO number auto-generated (format: PO-YYYY-###)
Assigned to specific vendor
Line items with final quantities and prices
Payment terms, expected delivery date
Status: sent (email/fax to vendor)
Vendor acknowledges: Status becomes acknowledged
Receiving (Parts Clerk)

When shipment arrives, clerk initiates receiving
Selects PO to receive against
For each line item:
Enter quantity received
If different from ordered, log discrepancy and reason
On save:
Creates ReceivingTransaction for each line
Updates Part.quantity_on_hand (+= quantity_received)
If all lines received, PO status: received
If partial, PO status: partially_received
Updates linked PartRequest records to fulfilled
Vendor Performance Tracking:

On-Time Delivery %: (POs delivered on/before expected_date / total POs) * 100
Quality Score: Manual rating (1-5 stars) after receipt inspection
Average Lead Time: avg(actual_delivery_date - order_date) across all POs
Used for vendor selection and performance reviews
Reorder Alerts:

Automated Generation: Runs nightly (or on-demand)
For each Part where quantity_on_hand <= reorder_point:
Creates ReorderAlert if one doesn't exist
Sets criticality based on is_critical flag and stock level
Status: pending
Parts clerk reviews alerts
Can bulk-create POs from multiple alerts:
Groups alerts by preferred vendor
Creates one PO per vendor with multiple line items
Sets alert status to ordered
7. Preventive Maintenance System
Operation: Schedule-driven recurring maintenance to prevent failures, with automatic due date calculation.

PM Schedule Configuration:

Interval Types:
Days: PM due every X days (e.g., 90 days)
Miles: PM due every X miles (e.g., 5,000 miles) - uses asset.current_meter_reading
Hours: PM due every X hours (e.g., 500 engine hours)
Tolerance: How early PM can be completed (e.g., 500 miles before due)
Grace: How late before marked overdue (e.g., 100 miles after due)
PM Instance Tracking (PMAssetInstance):

Each Asset + PM Schedule combination creates an instance
Tracks:
last_done_date and last_done_reading
due_date and due_reading (calculated)
current_status: not_due, due_soon, overdue
Status Logic:
overdue if current_date > (due_date + grace) OR current_reading > (due_reading + grace)
due_soon if within tolerance window
not_due otherwise
PM Completion Flow:

User creates WO for PM (or adds PM to existing WO)
Adds WO line with pm_id reference
Line includes checklist if PM has checklist_template_id
Technician completes checklist, marks line complete
Backend function triggers:
Finds PMAssetInstance for this asset + PM
Updates last_done_date = today
Updates last_done_reading = current asset meter reading
Calculates next due:
If interval type = days: due_date = last_done_date + interval_value
If interval type = miles/hours: due_reading = last_done_reading + interval_value
Updates current_status based on new due date/reading
Nested PMs:

Parent PM (e.g., "Annual Inspection") can have child PMs (e.g., "Q1 Inspection", "Q2 Inspection")
Completing a child PM doesn't affect parent's due date
Used for complex multi-stage maintenance
8. Manual System
Operation: Digital library with AI-powered content extraction for instant access to service information.

Upload & Processing Flow:

User uploads PDF manual
Metadata entered: make, model, year range
Status: processing
Backend AI Function (extractManualSections):
Extracts text from each page using OCR/PDF parser
Stores in ManualPageText entity
Uses LLM to identify sections:
Looks for table of contents
Identifies chapter/section headers
Extracts page ranges
Assigns VMRS codes where applicable
Creates ManualSection entities for each detected section
Calculates confidence score per section
Status: completed
Search & Retrieval:

Global Search: Full-text search across all ManualPageText records
Asset-Specific: Filters manuals by asset's make/model/year
VMRS-Based: When viewing WO line with VMRS code, suggests relevant manual sections
VIN-Based: Links manuals to specific VIN patterns via ManualVIN entity

9. Messages System
Operation: Internal team communication with entity linking for context-aware discussions.

Conversation Types:

Direct Message (DM): 2 participants
Group: Multiple participants, has a name
Message Flow:

User initiates conversation (selects participants)
System checks if DM already exists between these 2 users (prevents duplicates)
Creates Conversation entity with:
participants[] array of user emails
type: 'dm' or 'group'
User sends message
Creates Message entity:
conversation_id
sender_email
content
read_by[] starts as empty array
Updates parent Conversation:
last_message_text
last_message_date
last_message_sender
unread_by[] = all participants except sender
Real-time subscription updates all connected users
Unread Tracking:

When user opens conversation, adds their email to all Message.read_by[] arrays
Updates Conversation.unread_by to remove their email
Badge count in nav shows conversations.filter(c => c.unread_by.includes(user.email)).length
Entity Tagging (Schema Defined, UI Pending):

Message can have tagged_entities[] array
Each tag: {type: 'WorkOrder', id: 'wo_123', name: 'WO-2024-001'}
Enables: "Discussed this issue in [WO-2024-001]" with clickable link
10. Reports & Analytics System
Operation: Data aggregation and visualization with pre-built templates and custom builder.

Pre-Built Reports:

Work Order Cost by Asset:

Groups all WorkOrder records by asset_id
Sums total_cost per asset
Sorts by highest cost
Output: Asset Name, Total WOs, Total Cost, Avg Cost per WO
Asset Downtime Report:

For each asset, finds all WOs where status was down or maintenance_required
Calculates: downtime_hours = (completed_date - started_date) / 3600
Output: Asset Name, Total Downtime Hours, Number of Incidents, Avg Downtime per Incident
Parts Consumption:

Queries PartUsageHistory
Groups by part_id
Sums quantity_used and total_cost
Output: Part Number, Part Name, Total Qty Used, Total Cost, Avg Cost per Unit
Advanced Report Builder (Schema Exists, UI Pending):

User selects entity (e.g., WorkOrder)
Selects fields to display (e.g., work_order_number, asset_name, total_cost)
Builds filters (e.g., status = 'completed', created_date >= '2024-01-01')
Chooses grouping (e.g., group by asset_id)
Adds calculated fields (e.g., avg_cost = sum(total_cost) / count(id))
Selects visualization (table, bar chart, line chart)
Saves as ReportConfiguration
Report Scheduling:

User creates schedule: "Run Asset Downtime Report every Monday at 8am"
Creates ReportSchedule entity with cron expression
Backend automation triggers at scheduled time
Runs report, saves results to ReportRun
Emails PDF/Excel to specified recipients
11. Analytics & KPI System
Operation: Automated calculation of operational metrics with historical trending.

KPI Calculation (Backend Function calculateKPIs):

MTTR (Mean Time To Repair):

Query: All closed WOs with started_date and completed_date
Calculation: avg(completed_date - started_date)
Expressed in hours
MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):

For each asset, find all emergency/corrective WOs
Calculate time between each failure: (failure_date - previous_failure_date)
Average across all assets
Asset Uptime %:

Total hours in period (e.g., 720 hours in 30 days)
Downtime hours (sum of WO durations where asset was down)
Uptime % = ((total_hours - downtime_hours) / total_hours) * 100
PM Compliance %:

Count: PMs completed within tolerance window
Count: Total PMs due in period
Compliance % = (completed_on_time / total_due) * 100
Predictive Maintenance (functions/predictFailures):

Runs weekly or on-demand
For each asset:
Analyzes work order history (last 2 years)
Counts corrective vs preventive WOs
Identifies repeated part failures
Calculates failure frequency trend (increasing/decreasing)
Measures days since last failure
Assigns risk score (0-100)
For high-risk assets (score > 60):
Sends asset data + history to LLM
LLM analyzes and returns:
Most likely failure mode (e.g., "Hydraulic pump seal failure")
Recommended preventive actions (e.g., "Inspect pump seals, replace if worn")
Parts to stock (e.g., "P/N 12345 Seal Kit")
Probability percentage
Stores prediction in database
Manager reviews predictions, can create preventive WOs directly
12. Inspection & DVIR System
Operation: Structured data collection with automatic work order generation from defects.

Inspection Form Execution:

Technician selects asset and inspection form template
App displays each field sequentially
Field types:
Text input
Numeric measurement
Pass/Fail checkbox
Date selector
Signature capture
Photo upload
GPS coordinate capture
For each field, can add notes
On submit:
Creates Inspection entity
Creates InspectionResult for each field response
If any "Fail" responses, prompts: "Create Work Order?"
If yes, auto-creates WO with inspection results in description
DVIR (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report) Flow:

Driver performs pre-trip inspection
Fills out DVIR form (similar to inspection)
Finds defects (e.g., "Left front tire low pressure", "Brake fluid low")
For each defect:
Creates DVIRDefect entity
Assigns VMRS code if known
Status: reported
Creates parent DVIR entity:
Status: defects_found if any defects, else no_defects
Auto-WO Creation:
System automatically creates WO with type: 'dvir'
Creates one WorkOrderLine per defect
Each line links back to DVIRDefect via work_order_line_id
Asset status updated to maintenance_required
Technician completes lines
On completion, DVIRDefect.status updates to addressed
When all defects addressed, DVIR.status becomes resolved
13. Tire Management System
Operation: Complete lifecycle tracking from purchase through installation to disposal, with AI failure prediction.

Tire Lifecycle:

Purchase:

Create Tire entity with specs (size, brand, model, DOT code)
Initial status: in_stock
Tread depth recorded
Installation (TireAssignment):

Select tire from inventory
Select asset and position (e.g., "Left Front")
Creates TireAssignment entity:
tire_id
asset_id
position
installed_date
installed_meter_reading
status: 'active'
Tire status: installed
Monitoring:

TPMS readings (TPMSReading entity) track pressure/temp
Alerts if pressure drops below threshold
Periodic tread depth measurements stored on Tire
Removal:

Triggered from WO line or asset tire management
Enter removal reason (e.g., "Worn tread", "Puncture", "Rotation")
Updates TireAssignment:
removed_date
removed_meter_reading
removal_reason
status: 'removed'
AI Prediction Trigger:
Backend function predictTireFailure called
Sends: Asset data, tire data, removal reason, recent WO history
LLM analyzes and predicts:
Underlying issues (e.g., "Possible alignment problem causing uneven wear")
Confidence score
Recommended WOs (e.g., "Schedule alignment check")
Creates TirePrediction entity
UI displays prediction dialog
User can create suggested WOs with one click
Rotation:

14. Telematics Integration System
Operation: Real-time data ingestion from external systems with webhook processing.

Integration Setup:

Admin configures in Settings → Integrations
Creates IntegrationConnection:
Provider (e.g., "Samsara")
API credentials
Active status
Sets up webhook endpoint:
Creates IntegrationWebhook
URL: https://yourapp.base44.com/functions/integrationWebhookHandler
Registers URL with provider
Data Flow:

GPS Data:

Webhook receives: {vehicle_id, lat, lng, timestamp, speed, heading}
Creates GPSReading entity
Checks geofences: If vehicle exits designated area, creates alert
Fault Codes:

Webhook receives: {vehicle_id, fault_code, description, severity, timestamp}
Creates FaultCode entity
If severity = 'critical', auto-creates WO
TPMS:

Webhook receives tire pressure/temp data
Creates TPMSReading entity
If pressure < threshold, creates alert and suggests inspection WO
15. Security & Permission System
Operation: Multi-layered security with row-level data isolation and role-based feature access.

Row-Level Security (RLS):

Every user has assigned_location_ids[] array
Entity queries automatically filter:
Asset.location_id IN user.assigned_location_ids
WorkOrder.location_id IN user.assigned_location_ids
Part.location_id IN user.assigned_location_ids
Users only see data for their assigned locations
Multi-location users see combined dataset
Role-Based Access Control:

Admin: Full access, can modify all settings, view all locations
Manager: Approve requisitions, close WOs, view analytics, manage users at assigned locations
Technician: Create/edit WOs they're assigned to, post parts, log time
Parts Clerk: Manage inventory, approve part requests, create POs
Viewer: Read-only access to all data at assigned locations
Permission Guards:

UI components wrapped in <PermissionGuard requiredRoles={['admin', 'manager']}>
Buttons/actions hidden if user lacks permission
Backend validates permissions on write operations
This explains the operational workflows of each major system without diving into code implementation. Each system is designed to work independently while integrating seamlessly with related systems through shared entities and data flows.
